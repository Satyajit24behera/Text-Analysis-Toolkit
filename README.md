# Text-Analysis-Toolkit

This repository contains a Python toolkit for text analysis tasks, specifically focusing on sentence parsing, verb nature classification, and data visualization. The toolkit is designed to process a random subset of approximately 100 rows from your dataset, tokenize the text into sentences, and extract Subject - Verb - Object - Adjective relationships. The toolkit also classifies verbs as Descriptive, Interpretive, or State and handles cases with multiple verbs in a sentence by adding new rows or using JSON objects for convenient data storage. Additionally, it includes the generation of word clouds for verbs and adjectives, along with a frequency plot of verb nature across the randomly selected 100 rows.
